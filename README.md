# F1-RaceTrack
F1-RaceTrack is a game that uses classic (Newtonian) mechanics to simulate an F1 car race.

Martin Gardner, a science communicator famous for his mathematical puzzles, described the mathematical game RACETRACK in Scientific American in the early 1970s as a new game for the intellect (not luck) https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13122-6_26 

It was played on a sheet of graph paper with colored pencils.

On a sheet of graph paper, a race track was drawn, and each player marked the initial location of their car at the starting line by drawing a point at the intersection of a grid.
Each car has a horizontal speed and a vertical speed (at the start of the game, both speeds are zero). To simulate acceleration, braking, and direction changes, on each turn, each player can change their horizontal speed by a maximum of one grid per turn, and can similarly change their vertical speed by a maximum of one grid per turn. 
The winner is the first player to safely cross the finish line. 

The game introduced concepts of speed, acceleration, and vector components.

A good description of the original game is available at:

F1-RaceTrack is a computer game that simulates and recreates the Racetrack game, with Formula 1 cars.
